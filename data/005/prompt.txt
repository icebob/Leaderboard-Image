Imagine a scene where Isaac Newton is sitting on a bench in Washington Square Park with a prism on the table, but the image should be as if a tuxedoed, snobbish cat is looking down on him from a nearby trash can. The image should be photorealistic, but the cat should reflect the fierce gaze of a tiger in the puddle next to him.
