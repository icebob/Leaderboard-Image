I'm opening a traditional concept restaurant in Marin called Haein. It focuses on Korean food cooked with organic, farm-fresh ingredients, with a rotating menu based on what's seasonal. I want you to design an image - a menu incorporating the following menu items - lean into the traditional/rustic style while keeping it feeling upscale and sleek. Please also include illustrations of each dish in an elegant, peter rabbit style. Make sure all the text is rendered correctly, with a white background.
